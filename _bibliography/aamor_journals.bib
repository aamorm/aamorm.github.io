  abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) has benefited recently from the introduction of the domain decomposition method (DDM), especially to tackle large-scale problems. Many versions of DDM may be found in the literature, and almost none of them have used a rigorous approach to show the accuracy of the formulation. Here, we suggest the use of the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) to introduce DDM into a FEM code. This approach also allows us to debug the demanding coding process of the method. First, we introduce the mandatory operators used for DDM to construct second-order absorbing boundary conditions. Then, we use these results to show the correct implementation of DDM with basis functions up to fourth order for tetrahedra, triangular prisms, and hexahedra, obtaining the convergence rates predicted by the classic FEM theory. Finally, we illustrate how to use MMS to test different formulations, assessing the effect of using different spaces and orders for the arising ancillary variables.},

  abstract = {A general method for calculating the mass and stiffness matrices of H(curl)-conforming finite elements is pro- posed. It applies to curvilinear geometries geometry and/or inhomogeneous materials, preserves the nullspace of the curl operator, and is computationally efficient. In the finite element integrals, the terms incorporating the effects of geometry and materials are expanded in a series of multivariate polynomials. As a result, the element matrices can always be integrated analytically by means of predefined universal matrices. The mapping from the reference element to the physical configuration is done performed by suitable forms of the Piola transformation the Piola transformations so that the resulting finite element bases are guaranteed to preserve the nullspace of the curl operator. A mathematical proof, including the curvilinear case, is included. The suggested approach features a representation limit: When the metric expansion is continued beyond a critical order, which is determined by the order of the finite element basis, the truncation error becomes zero. Hence, the number of universal matrices is bounded, and the sole source of error is the numerical calculation of the expansion coefficients for the metric terms. The method is validated by numerical examples, and its computational efficiency is demonstrated by a comparison to competing approaches.},

The approach is mathematically sound since we obtain the functions as the dual basis with respect to properly discretized N\'ed\'elec degrees of freedom. Simple to use and well-conditioned bases without the need for added orthogonalization procedures are obtained. We provide simple closed-form expressions for second-order basis functions in a reference hexahedron in terms of integer coefficients and monomials. The expressions are ready to use as long as the appropriate geometric mappings are made. We apply the Method of Manufactured Solutions to a finite element double curl vector wave formulation for verification purposes; specifically, we make a study of the non-symmetrical structure of the corresponding tensor product finite element space. We also solve generalized eigenvalue problems for well-known cavities. We provide the open-source code for generating the coefficients, evaluating the basis functions, and computing the finite element matrices involved in some of the numerical solutions shown in the paper.},

  abstract = {Achieving maximum parallel performance on multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs is a challenging task depending on multiple factors. These include, for example, the number and granularity of the computations or the use of the memories of the devices. In this paper, we assess those factors by evaluating and comparing different parallelizations of the same problem on a multiprocessor containing a CPU with 40 cores and four P100 GPUs with Pascal architecture. We use, as study case, the convolutional operation behind a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique in the context of open region electromagnetic wave propagation problems. A total of six parallel algorithms implemented using OpenMP and CUDA have been used to carry out the comparison by leveraging the same levels of parallelism on both types of platforms. Three of the algorithms are presented for the first time in this paper, including a multi-GPU method, and two others are improved versions of algorithms previously developed by some of the authors. This paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the parallel algorithms on a radar cross-sectional prediction problem. Results show that performance obtained on the GPU clearly overcomes those obtained in the CPU, much more so if we use multiple GPUs to distribute both data and computations. Accelerations close to 30 have been obtained on the CPU, while with the multi-GPU version accelerations larger than 250 have been achieved.},

Our high-order\,h+p refinement strategy is based on and extends the PETGEM code. We focus on the performance study in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, and computational effort to solve real-life 3D setups based on synthetic and experimental data for energy reservoir characterization. These test cases show variable resolution discretization needs and realistic physical parameters. In general, our numerical results are consistent theoretically. The use of\,h-adapted meshes was efficient to achieve a certain accuracy level in the synthetic EM responses. Regarding global\,p-refinement,\,p=2 exhibits the best accuracy/performance trade-off. Selective\,p-refinement might offer a better compromise between accuracy and computational cost. However, for\,p-refinement at different entities, the best refinement scheme consists of using\,p=3 at the volume level with\,p=1 at faces and edges. Thus,\,p-refinement can be competitive if applied hierarchically. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the performance of our supervised\,h+p refinement strategy depends on the input model (e.g., conductivity, frequency, domain decomposition strategy, among others). Whatever the chosen configuration, our numerical results provide an in-depth understanding of EM modeling's pros and cons when supervised\,h+p refinement schemes are applied.},

We assess the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the code using a set of reference models developed by the MT community in well-known reported workshops. The scale and geological properties of these 3D MT setups are challenging, making them ideal for addressing a rigorous validation. Our numerical assessment proves that this new algorithm can produce the expected solutions for arbitrarily 3D MT models. Also, our extensive experimental results reveal four main insights: (1) high-order discretizations in conjunction with tailored meshes can offer excellent accuracy; (2) a rigorous mesh design based on the skin-depth principle can be beneficial for the solution of the 3D MT problem in terms of numerical accuracy and run-time; (3) high-order polynomial basis functions achieve better speed-up and parallel efficiency ratios than low-order polynomial basis functions on cutting-edge HPC platforms; (4) a triple helix approach based on HEFEM, tailored meshes, and HPC can be extremely competitive for the solution of realistic and complex 3D MT models and geophysical electromagnetics in general.},

  abstract = {Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM) have been widely used in the Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) community in the last years to tackle large-scale problems with Finite Element Methods (FEM). Non-conformal DDM is more flexible (e.g., independently created meshes for different parts of the problem under analysis are supported) but may introduce an approximation error. In this communication, a thorough study of the accuracy of the solutions when using non-conformal DDM is presented.  Three experiments are realized showing the verification of the implementation and that the accuracy is acceptable with different numbers of discontinuities in the propagation direction and various aspect ratios of the mesh on the interface. The numerical results use three different shapes (tetrahedra, prisms, and hexahedra) and up to order three in the basis functions that approximate the field. These studies are relevant for the introduction of non-conformal DDM with real problems or scalable (in the parallel sense) implementation of adaptive mesh techniques.},

  abstract = {The emergence of General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) provides new opportunities to accelerate applications involving a large number of regular computations. However, properly leveraging the computational resources of graphical processors is a very challenging task. In this paper, we use this kind of device to parallelize FE-IIEE (Finite Element-Iterative Integral Equation Evaluation), a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique introduced by two of the authors. This application is computationally very demanding due to the amount, size and complexity of the data involved in the procedure. Besides, an efficient implementation becomes even more difficult if the parallelization has to maintain the complex workflow of the original code. The proposed implementation using CUDA applies different optimization techniques to improve performance. These include leveraging the fastest memories of the GPU and increasing the granularity of the computations to reduce the impact of memory access. We have applied our parallel algorithm to two real radiation and scattering problems demonstrating speedups higher than 140 on a state-of-the-art GPU.},

  abstract = {Finite element method (FEM) has been used for years for radiation problems in the field of electromagnetism. To tackle problems of this kind, mesh truncation techniques are required, which may lead to the use of high computational resources. In fact, electrically large radiation problems can only be tackled using massively parallel computational resources. Different types of multi-core machines are commonly employed in diverse fields of science for accelerating a number of applications. However, properly managing their computational resources becomes a very challenging task. On the one hand, we present a hybrid message passing interface + OpenMP-based acceleration of a mesh truncation technique included in a FEM code for electromagnetism in a high-performance computing cluster equipped with 140 compute nodes. Results show that we obtain about 85\% of the theoretical maximum speedup of the machine. On the other hand, a graphics processing unit has been used to accelerate one of the parts that presents high fine-grain parallelism.},

  abstract = {Preservation of privacy in data mining and machine learning has emerged as an absolute prerequisite in many practical scenarios, especially when the processing of sensitive data is outsourced to an external third party. Currently, privacy preservation methods are mainly based on randomization and/or perturbation, secure multiparty computations and cryptographic methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the partial homomorphic property of some cryptosystems to train simple machine learning models with encrypted data. Our basic scenario has three parties: multiple Data Owners, which provide encrypted training examples; the Algorithm Owner (or Application), which processes them to adjust the parameters of its models; and a semi-trusted third party, which provides privacy and secure computation services to the Application in some operations not supported by the homomorphic cryptosystem. In particular, we focus on two issues: the use of multiple-key cryptosystems, and the impact of the quantization of real-valued input data required before encryption. In addition, we develop primitives based on the outsourcing of a reduced set of operations that allows to implement general machine learning algorithms using efficient dedicated hardware. As applications, we consider the training of classifiers using privacy-protected data and the tracking of a moving target using encrypted distance measurements.},

As machine learning model, we have selected the Support Vector Machine (SVM) due to its excellent performance in supervised classification tasks. We evaluate two well known SVM algorithms, and we also propose a new semiparametric SVM scheme better suited for the privacy-protected scenario.
