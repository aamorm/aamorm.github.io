  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic design methodology for amplifier-based active sensors, with stability as a central consideration. The proposed sensor consists of a passive resonant structure and an active element connected in series to form a single-port amplifier operating in reflection. A lumped-element equivalent circuit was first employed to determine an initial value for the impedance of the active element, which was used as starting point for the design using realistic models of a Complementary Split-Ring Resonator (CSRR), for the passive resonant structure, and a Clapp oscillator, for the active element. The Clapp oscillator was optimized until until a threefold improvement in the quality factor compared to the passive case without compromising the stability of the system. The sensing performance of the proposed active sensor was validated both in simulation and measurements on lossy samples, showing improved performance without compromising its sensitivity. System stability was confirmed by examining the NDF (in simulation) and the spectral response (in simulation and measurement). Despite promising results were obtained, further optimization of the active element is required to increase the stability margins and the quality factor. Moreover, the integration of both the passive resonant structure and the active element subsystems into a single compact circuit, as well as the analysis of nonlinear effects, should be addressed in future works.},

  abstract = {The reliability of neural networks on Edge AI platforms is crucial for safety-critical applications, especially in environments exposed to radiation. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the reliability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed on low-power System-on-Chip (SoC) devices, specifically the Jetson Orin Nano. The study explores the impact of neutron radiation on these models, focusing on the effect of optimisation techniques such as TensorRT, data precision reduction, and weight quantisation. Results indicate that while optimisation can improve inference performance, it may also increase the error rates in outputs. Additionally, including main memory in the radiation tests resulted in severe persistent errors, highlighting the need for thorough reliability assessments in real-world scenarios. A comparison between ViTs and CNNs revealed that ViTs, despite their complexity, show comparable or better reliability on modern SoCs, which is critical for deploying AI in safety-critical environments like aerospace and autonomous driving.},

This study demonstrates the efficient execution of a medium-sized self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) model on a low-power system-on-chip (SoC). Through comprehensive evaluation, including real time inference scenarios, we show that GPUs outperform multi-core CPUs in inference processes. Optimization techniques such as adjusting batch size, model compilation with TensorRT, and reducing data precision significantly enhance inference time, energy consumption, and memory usage. In particular, negligible accuracy degradation is observed, with post-training quantization to 8-bit integers showing less than 1\% loss. This research underscores the feasibility of deploying transformer neural networks on low-power embedded devices, ensuring efficiency in time, energy, and memory, while maintaining the accuracy of the results.},

Many versions of DDM may be found in the literature, and almost none of them have used a rigorous approach to show the accuracy of the formulation. Here, we suggest the use of the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) to introduce DDM into a FEM code. This approach also allows us to debug the demanding coding process of the method. First, we introduce the mandatory operators used for DDM to construct second-order absorbing boundary conditions. Then, we use these results to show the correct implementation of DDM with basis functions up to fourth order for tetrahedra, triangular prisms, and hexahedra, obtaining the convergence rates predicted by the classic FEM theory. Finally, we illustrate how to use MMS to test different formulations, assessing the effect of using different spaces and orders for the arising ancillary variables.},

  abstract = {A general method for calculating the mass and stiffness matrices of H(curl)-conforming finite elements is pro- posed. It applies to curvilinear geometries geometry and/or inhomogeneous materials, preserves the nullspace of the curl operator, and is computationally efficient. In the finite element integrals, the terms incorporating the effects of geometry and materials are expanded in a series of multivariate polynomials. As a result, the element matrices can always be integrated analytically by means of predefined universal matrices. The mapping from the reference element to the physical configuration is done performed by suitable forms of the Piola transformation the Piola transformations so that the resulting finite element bases are guaranteed to preserve the nullspace of the curl operator. A mathematical proof, including the curvilinear case, is included. The suggested approach features a representation limit: When the metric expansion is continued beyond a critical order, which is determined by the order of the finite element basis, the truncation error becomes zero. Hence, the number of universal matrices is bounded, and the sole source of error is the numerical calculation of the expansion coefficients for the metric terms. The method is validated by numerical examples, and its computational efficiency is demonstrated by a comparison to competing approaches.},

This paper investigates the mesh design for subsurface models, including steel-cased wells, which is relevant for many exploration settings but still remains a numerically challenging task. Applying a goal-oriented mesh refinement technique and subsequent calculations with the high-order edge finite element method, simulations of 3D controlled-source electromagnetic models in the presence of metallic infrastructure are performed. Two test models are considered, each needing a distinct version of approximation methods to incorporate the conductive steel casings of the included wells. The influence of mesh quality, goal-oriented meshing, and high-order approximations on problem sizes, computational cost, and accuracy of electromagnetic responses is investigated. The main insights of our work are: (a) the applied numerical schemes can mitigate the computational burden of geo-electromagnetic modeling in the presence of steel artifacts; (b) investigating the processes driving the meshing of models with embedded metallic infrastructures can lead to adequate strategies to deal with the inversion of such electromagnetic data sets. Based on the modeling results and analyses conducted, general recommendations for modeling strategies are proposed when performing simulations for challenging steel infrastructure scenarios.},

Simple to use and well-conditioned bases without the need for added orthogonalization procedures are obtained. We provide simple closed-form expressions for second-order basis functions in a reference hexahedron in terms of integer coefficients and monomials. The expressions are ready to use as long as the appropriate geometric mappings are made. We apply the Method of Manufactured Solutions to a finite element double curl vector wave formulation for verification purposes; specifically, we make a study of the non-symmetrical structure of the corresponding tensor product finite element space. We also solve generalized eigenvalue problems for well-known cavities. We provide the open-source code for generating the coefficients, evaluating the basis functions, and computing the finite element matrices involved in some of the numerical solutions shown in the paper.},

Here, a tool to determine if a family of basis functions belongs to the Nédélec space is provided. Since affine coordinates are the most frequent choice for simplices, particularities about its use with this kind of coordinates are detailed. A detailed survey of existing families is provided, and the practical application of the tool to a representative set of these families is discussed.

These include, for example, the number and granularity of the computations or the use of the memories of the devices. In this paper, we assess those factors by evaluating and comparing different parallelizations of the same problem on a multiprocessor containing a CPU with 40 cores and four P100 GPUs with Pascal architecture. We use, as study case, the convolutional operation behind a non-standard finite element mesh truncation technique in the context of open region electromagnetic wave propagation problems. A total of six parallel algorithms implemented using OpenMP and CUDA have been used to carry out the comparison by leveraging the same levels of parallelism on both types of platforms. Three of the algorithms are presented for the first time in this paper, including a multi-GPU method, and two others are improved versions of algorithms previously developed by some of the authors. This paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation of the parallel algorithms on a radar cross-sectional prediction problem. Results show that performance obtained on the GPU clearly overcomes those obtained in the CPU, much more so if we use multiple GPUs to distribute both data and computations. Accelerations close to 30 have been obtained on the CPU, while with the multi-GPU version accelerations larger than 250 have been achieved.},

By following the Plebanski formalism, a space-time metric of the aforementioned type is first encoded into the electromagnetic properties of a flat space-time region in the form of an isotropic and radially varying refractive index distribution. Then, a three-dimensional, air-filled, and axially symmetric waveguide, composed of two equally spaced and curved metallic surfaces, is employed. Its shape is tailored such that the effective paths, followed by transverse electromagnetic beams of microwave radiation within this waveguide, result equivalent to null-geodesics taking place in the aforementioned refractive medium. This strategy avoids the need for a refractive medium, although it only allows to reproduce the space-time metric on the invariant plane. Two analog electromagnetic models of gravity, using the proposed approach, are designed to reproduce the metric of both a Schwarzschild black hole and a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The results from full-wave simulations demonstrate that a one-dimensional Gaussian beam faithfully follows a path completely equivalent to general relativistic null geodesics with a mean relative error within 4\%.},

However, for\,p-refinement at different entities, the best refinement scheme consists of using\,p=3 at the volume level with\,p=1 at faces and edges. Thus,\,p-refinement can be competitive if applied hierarchically. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the performance of our supervised\,h+p refinement strategy depends on the input model (e.g., conductivity, frequency, domain decomposition strategy, among others). Whatever the chosen configuration, our numerical results provide an in-depth understanding of EM modeling's pros and cons when supervised\,h+p refinement schemes are applied.},

  abstract = {We present a routine for 3D magnetotelluric (MT) modeling based upon high-order edge finite element method (HEFEM), tailored and unstructured tetrahedral meshes, and high-performance computing (HPC). This implementation extends the PETGEM modeller capabilities, initially developed for active-source electromagnetic methods in frequency-domain. We assess the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the code using a set of reference models developed by the MT community in well-known reported workshops. The scale and geological properties of these 3D MT setups are challenging, making them ideal for addressing a rigorous validation. Our numerical assessment proves that this new algorithm can produce the expected solutions for arbitrarily 3D MT models. Also, our extensive experimental results reveal four main insights: (1) high-order discretizations in conjunction with tailored meshes can offer excellent accuracy; (2) a rigorous mesh design based on the skin-depth principle can be beneficial for the solution of the 3D MT problem in terms of numerical accuracy and run-time; (3) high-order polynomial basis functions achieve better speed-up and parallel efficiency ratios than low-order polynomial basis functions on cutting-edge HPC platforms; (4) a triple helix approach based on HEFEM, tailored meshes, and HPC can be extremely competitive for the solution of realistic and complex 3D MT models and geophysical electromagnetics in general.},

Non-conformal DDM is more flexible (e.g., independently created meshes for different parts of the problem under analysis are supported) but may introduce an approximation error. In this communication, a thorough study of the accuracy of the solutions when using non-conformal DDM is presented.  Three experiments are realized showing the verification of the implementation and that the accuracy is acceptable with different numbers of discontinuities in the propagation direction and various aspect ratios of the mesh on the interface. The numerical results use three different shapes (tetrahedra, prisms, and hexahedra) and up to order three in the basis functions that approximate the field. These studies are relevant for the introduction of non-conformal DDM with real problems or scalable (in the parallel sense) implementation of adaptive mesh techniques.},

This application is computationally very demanding due to the amount, size and complexity of the data involved in the procedure. Besides, an efficient implementation becomes even more difficult if the parallelization has to maintain the complex workflow of the original code. The proposed implementation using CUDA applies different optimization techniques to improve performance. These include leveraging the fastest memories of the GPU and increasing the granularity of the computations to reduce the impact of memory access.

Currently, privacy preservation methods are mainly based on randomization and/or perturbation, secure multiparty computations and cryptographic methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the partial homomorphic property of some cryptosystems to train simple machine learning models with encrypted data. Our basic scenario has three parties: multiple Data Owners, which provide encrypted training examples; the Algorithm Owner (or Application), which processes them to adjust the parameters of its models; and a semi-trusted third party, which provides privacy and secure computation services to the Application in some operations not supported by the homomorphic cryptosystem. In particular, we focus on two issues: the use of multiple-key cryptosystems, and the impact of the quantization of real-valued input data required before encryption. In addition, we develop primitives based on the outsourcing of a reduced set of operations that allows to implement general machine learning algorithms using efficient dedicated hardware. As applications, we consider the training of classifiers using privacy-protected data and the tracking of a moving target using encrypted distance measurements.},
