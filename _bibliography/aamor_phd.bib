  abstract = {In the last years, more and more accurate and demanding simulations of radiofrequency components in a system of communications are requested by the community. To address this need, some techniques have been introduced in finite element methods (FEM), such as hp adaptivity (which estimates the error in the problem and generates tailored meshes to achieve more accuracy with less unknowns than in the case of uniformly refined meshes) or domain decomposition methods (DDM, consisting of dividing the whole problem into more manageable subdomains which can be solved in parallel). The performance of the adaptivity techniques is good up to two dimensions, whereas for three dimensions the generation time of the adapted meshes may be prohibitive. On the other hand, large scale simulations have been reported with DDM becoming a hot topic in the computational electromagnetics community. The main objective of this dissertation is to study the viability of scalable (in terms of parallel performance) algorithms combining nonconformal DDM and automatic adaptivity in three dimensions. Specifically, the adaptivity algorithms might be run in each subdomain independently. This combination has not been detailed in the literature and a proof of concept is discussed in this work. Thus, three building blocks must be introduced: i) basis functions for the finite elements which support non-uniform approximation orders p; ii) non-conformal and non-overlapping DDM; and iii) adaptivity algorithms in 3D. In this work, these three building blocks have been successfully introduced in a FEM code with a systematic procedure based on the method of manufactured solutions (MMS). Moreover, a three-level parallelization (at the algorithm level, with DDM; at the process level, with message passing interface (MPI), and at the thread level, with OpenMP) has been developed using the paradigm of modular programming which eases the software maintenance and the introduction of new features. Regarding first building block, a family of basis functions which follows a sound mathematical approach to expand the correct space of functions is developed and particularized for triangular prisms. Also, to ease the introduction of different approximation orders in the same mesh, hierarchical basis functions from other authors are used as a black box. With respect to DDM, a thorough study of the error introduced by the non-conformal interfaces between subdomains is required for the adaptivity algorithm. Thus, a quantitative analysis is detailed including non-conformalities generated by independent refinements in neighbor subdomains. This error has not been assessed with detail in the literature and it is a key factor for the adaptivity algorithm to perform properly. An adaptivity algorithm with triangular prisms is also developed and special considerations for the implementation are explained. Finally, on top of these three building blocks, the proof of concept of adaptivity with DDM is discussed.},
