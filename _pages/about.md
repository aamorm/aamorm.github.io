Born in Móstoles and raised in Toledo, Spain. I am an **associate professor** at
University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain) from March 2025.

My track record sits at the intersection of computational electromagnetics (CEM) in the Hz and GHz regime, high-performance computing (HPC), and AI-assisted inverse problems. I develop verified, curl-conforming high-order finite element method (FEM) technology and specific accelerators, and I take them all the way to production—open code, industrial transfer (AIRBUS), and measurement-driven validation. International collaboration is a constant (59.5% of my outputs involve international co-authors), and 68.2% of my papers appear in the Q1 CiteScore journals. I have authored or co-authored 29 JCR-indexed papers (25 in Q1/Q2 journals) and contributed to 54 conferences. 

As Principal Investigator (PI), I have led 2 national and 2 regional publicly funded research projects, as well as two private research contracts, totaling over €500,000. I have also been granted a Ramón y Cajal fellowship in 2025, the most prestigious tenure-track program in Spain. I have participated in 6 additional research projects and 9 private contracts and hold one six-year research period (2015-2020). I have opened two research lines (inverse problems and active sensors) within my group. My international experience includes 33 months at foreign institutions with competitive grants or contracts, yielding high-quality results (i.e., JCR papers and conferences).

Related to teaching, I have imparted more than 1000 teaching hours in different
Telecommunication bachelor and master degrees in the last 10 years. You can find
more details (in Spanish) **[here.](https://aamorm.github.io/teaching)**

See my **[CV](https://aamorm.github.io/cv)** for my participation in research
projects and organizations. You can also download my
**[CVN](https://cvn.fecyt.es/0000-0002-6123-4324)** and
**[CVA](/assets/pdf/cva_aamor.pdf)**.

<!-- I am the current coordinator at the **[GT-Jóvenes](https://www.coit.es/grupos-de-trabajo/gt-jovenes)** at the Spanish College of Telecommunications Engineers (COIT), and I have also been appointed to the Spanish committee of **[URSI](https://ursi.es/comite-nacional/)** as the representative of young researchers in the field of radio science. I am also the representative of my university in the international working group IEEE P2816 APS/SC/CEM on computational electromagnetics.
