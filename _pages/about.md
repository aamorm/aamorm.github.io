Born in Móstoles and raised in Toledo, Spain. I am an **assistant professor** at
University Carlos III of Madrid (Spain) from February 2021.

My research interests are **computational electromagnetics**, High Performance
Computing (HPC) techniques, and antenna measurements. I am part of **23 indexed
papers** and **45 conference papers**. I was a **postdoctoral researcher** at
Saarland University from 2019 to 2020 with Prof. Dyczij-Edlinger. I have also
been a **visiting scholar** at The Ohio State University hosted by Prof. Jin-Fa
Lee for seven months, and at the University of Macau for two months. 

Related to teaching, I have imparted more than 1000 teaching hours in different
Telecommunication bachelor and master degrees in the last 10 years. You can find
more details (in Spanish) **[here.](https://aamorm.github.io/teaching)**

See my **[CV](https://aamorm.github.io/cv)** for my participation in research
projects and in organizations. You can also download my
**[CVN](https://cvn.fecyt.es/0000-0002-6123-4324)** and
**[CVA](/assets/pdf/cva_aamor.pdf)**.

<!-- I am the current coordinator at the **[GT-Jóvenes](https://www.coit.es/grupos-de-trabajo/gt-jovenes)** at the Spanish College of Telecommunications Engineers (COIT), and I have also been appointed to the Spanish committee of **[URSI](https://ursi.es/comite-nacional/)** as the representative of young researchers in the field of radio science. I am also the representative of my university in the international working group IEEE P2816 APS/SC/CEM on computational electromagnetics.
