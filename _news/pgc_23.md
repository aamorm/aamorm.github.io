We got funding for a very interesting project (Spatial Audio and Array Processing for Industrial Applications and Digital Transformation: Efficient Implementations through Parallel and Approximate Computing), funded by Agencia Estatal de Investigación in their national call *Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento 2022*, and I am the Principal Investigator with José A. Belloch. If you want to get involved in the project, just drop me an email!
