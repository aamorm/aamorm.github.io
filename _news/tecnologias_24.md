We got funding for a very interesting project (DISCO6G-CM: Desarrollo e Integraci√≥n de Sensores y COmunicaciones para servicios avanzados en 6G) funded by the Regional Government of Madrid, where I am the Principal Investigator of an emerging group within the consortium. If you want to get involved in the project, just drop me an email!
