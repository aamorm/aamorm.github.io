We got funding for a very interesting project (MIMACUHSPACE-CM, MIcrowave MAterial Characterization Using Heterogeneous Systems-on-chip for SPACE applications) funded by the regional government of Madrid, where I am the Principal Investigator with Jos√© A. Belloch. If you want to get involved in the project, just drop me an email!
