I have organized an event for the presentation of the [Ambassadors program](https://ambassadorstelecorenta.github.io/), which is a program to encourage the transfer of knowledge from engineers to high schools. The first talk was given by David Calle, from Unicoos. If you were not able to attend, please have a look at [the recording here](https://www.youtube.com/live/EPdTn9Qp_W4).
