I will give an invited talk at the European School of Antennas (ESOA) course *Fundamentals on Antennas* about the use of AI in antennas. They have [a very interesting agenda](https://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~aamor/ESOA2025/index.html). I am looking forward to meeting you there! The slides are [here](/assets/pdf/ai_slides_aamor.pdf).
